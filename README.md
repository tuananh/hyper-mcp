# hyper-mcp

A fast, secure MCP server that extends its capabilities through WebAssembly plugins.

## What is it?

hyper-mcp makes it easy to add AI capabilities to your applications. It works with Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, and other MCP-compatible apps. Write plugins in your favorite language, distribute them through container registries, and run them anywhere - from cloud to edge.

## Features

- Write plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly
- Distribute plugins via standard OCI registries (like Docker Hub)
- Built on [Extism](https://github.com/extism/extism) for rock-solid plugin support
- Lightweight enough for resource-constrained environments
- Support all 3 protocols in the spec: `stdio`, `sse` and `streamble-http`.
- Deploy anywhere: serverless, edge, mobile, IoT devices
- Cross-platform compatibility out of the box

## Security

Built with security-first mindset:

- Sandboxed plugins that can't access your system without permission
- Memory-safe execution with resource limits
- Secure plugin distribution through container registries
- Fine-grained access control for host functions
- OCI plugin images are signed at publish time and verified at load time with [sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/).

## Getting Started

1. Create your config file:
   - Linux: `$HOME/.config/hyper-mcp/config.json`
   - Windows: `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}`. Eg: `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming`
   - macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/hyper-mcp/config.json`

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "time",
      "path": "oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/time-plugin:latest"
    },
    {
      "name": "qr-code",
      "path": "oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/qrcode-plugin:latest"
    },
    {
      "name": "hash",
      "path": "oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/hash-plugin:latest"
    },
    {
      "name": "myip",
      "path": "oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/myip-plugin:latest",
      "runtime_config": {
        "allowed_hosts": ["1.1.1.1"]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "fetch",
      "path": "oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/fetch-plugin:latest",
      "runtime_config": {
        "allowed_hosts": ["*"],
        "memory_limit": "100 MB"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Start the server:

```sh
$ hyper-mcp
```

- By default, it will use `stdio` transport. If you want to use SSE, use flag `--transport sse` or streamable HTTP with `--transport streamable-http`.
- If you want to debug, use `RUST_LOG=info`.
- If you're loading unsigned OCI plugin, you need to set `insecure_skip_signature` flag or env var `HYPER_MCP_INSECURE_SKIP_SIGNATURE` to `true`

## Using with Cursor IDE

You can configure hyper-mcp either globally for all projects or specifically for individual projects.

1. For project-scope configuration, create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hyper-mcp": {
      "command": "/path/to/hyper-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

2. Set up hyper-mcp in Cursor's settings:
   ![cursor mcp](./assets/cursor-mcp.png)

3. Start using tools through chat:
