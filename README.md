# hyper-mcp

A fast, secure MCP server that extends its capabilities through WebAssembly plugins.

## What is it?

hyper-mcp makes it easy to add AI capabilities to your applications. It works with Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, and other MCP-compatible apps. Write plugins in your favorite language, distribute them through container registries, and run them anywhere - from cloud to edge.

## Features

- Write plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly
- Distribute plugins via standard OCI registries (like Docker Hub)
- Built on [Extism](https://github.com/extism/extism) for rock-solid plugin support
- Sanboxing with WASM: ability to limit network, filesystem, memory access
- Lightweight enough for resource-constrained environments
- Support all 3 protocols in the spec: `stdio`, `sse` and `streamble-http`.
- Deploy anywhere: serverless, edge, mobile, IoT devices
- Cross-platform compatibility out of the box
- Support tool name prefix to prevent tool names collision

## Security

Built with security-first mindset:

- Sandboxed plugins that can't access your system without permission
- Memory-safe execution with resource limits
- Secure plugin distribution through container registries
- Fine-grained access control for host functions
- OCI plugin images are signed at publish time and verified at load time with [sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/).

## Getting Started

1. Create your config file:
   - Linux: `$HOME/.config/hyper-mcp/config.json`
   - Windows: `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}`. Eg: `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming`
   - macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/hyper-mcp/config.json`

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "time",
      "url": "oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/time-plugin:latest"
    },
    {
      "name": "qr-code",
      "url": "oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/qrcode-plugin:latest"
    },
    {
      "name": "hash",
      "url": "oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/hash-plugin:latest"
    },
    {
      "name": "myip",
      "url": "oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/myip-plugin:latest",
      "runtime_config": {
        "allowed_hosts": ["1.1.1.1"]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "fetch",
      "url": "oci://ghcr.io/tuananh/fetch-plugin:latest",
      "runtime_config": {
        "allowed_hosts": ["*"],
        "memory_limit": "100 MB",
        "tool_name_prefix": "foo_"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported URL schemes:
- `oci://` - for OCI-compliant registries (like Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.)
- `file://` - for local files
- `http://` or `https://` - for remote files
- `s3://` - for Amazon S3 objects (requires that you have your AWS credentials set up in the environment)

2. Start the server:

```sh
$ hyper-mcp
```

- By default, it will use `stdio` transport. If you want to use SSE, use flag `--transport sse` or streamable HTTP with `--transport streamable-http`.
- If you want to debug, use `RUST_LOG=info`.
- If you're loading unsigned OCI plugin, you need to set `insecure_skip_signature` flag or env var `HYPER_MCP_INSECURE_SKIP_SIGNATURE` to `true`

## Using with Cursor IDE

You can configure hyper-mcp either globally for all projects or specifically for individual projects.

1. For project-scope configuration, create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hyper-mcp": {
      "command": "/path/to/hyper-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

2. Set up hyper-mcp in Cursor's settings:
   ![cursor mcp](./assets/cursor-mcp.png)

3. Start using tools through chat:

## Creating Plugins

1. Install the [XTP CLI](https://docs.xtp.dylibso.com/docs/cli):
    ```sh
    curl https://static.dylibso.com/cli/install.sh -s | bash
    ```

2. Create a new plugin project:
    ```sh
    xtp plugin init --schema-file plugin-schema.yaml
    ```
    Follow the prompts to set up your plugin. This will create the necessary files and structure.

    For example, if you chose Rust as the language, it will create a `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs` and a `src/pdk.rs` file.

3. Implement your plugin logic in the language appropriate files(s) created (e.g. - `Cargo.toml` and `src/lib.rs` for Rust)
    For example, if you chose Rust as the language you will need to update the `Cargo.toml` and `src/lib.rs` files.

    Be sure to modify the `.gitignore` that is created for you to allow committing your `Cargo.lock` file.

Check out our [example plugins](https://github.com/tuananh/hyper-mcp/tree/main/examples/plugins) for insight.

To publish a plugin:

```dockerfile
# example how to build with rust
FROM rust:1.88-slim AS builder

RUN rustup target add wasm32-wasip1 && \
    rustup component add rust-std --target wasm32-wasip1 && \
    cargo install cargo-auditable

WORKDIR /workspace
COPY . .
RUN cargo fetch
RUN cargo auditable build --release --target wasm32-wasip1
